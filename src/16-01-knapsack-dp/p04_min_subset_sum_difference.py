# this out without knowing `sum2` but what is `sum2` at that point?

# trying to get a subset sum as close as possible to half of the total sum of
# all the numbers.

# a subset sum of half the total sum. When the full table is filled, the largest
# sum in the last row (considering all elements) represents the closest subset
# sum you can get to half, which you can then use to calculate the other
# subset's total and get the difference.
